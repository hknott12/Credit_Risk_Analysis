# Credit Risk Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project was to use supervised machine learning models to predict the amount of risk in giving a loan, classifying the loans a good or bad. Six machine learning models were tested, and the balanced accuracy score, precision, and recall were compared to determine the best model to use to predict credit risk.
